Week1 tasks was to recap "Python" and Learn about "Git", "Github", "Terminal Command lines."

Next task was to solve a problem on Markov chains using python, which is basic foundation for 
"Reinforcement learning (RL)"

I have completed the task, and also took suggestions from my mentors for improvement.
