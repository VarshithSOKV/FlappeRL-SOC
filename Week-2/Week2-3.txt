Week 2-3 tasks was to learn basics of Reinforcement learning,

 - starting with terminology such as agent, reward, state, policy etc..

 - calculating value of the state by Bellman equations

 - iterative methods such as Policy iteration and Value iteration

Next task was to solve 2 problems based on learnt iterative methods,

 - First was an MDP whose policy was given and Value function hws to be found 
   using Value iteration method.

 - Second was a Maze problem whose wall position and start, destination were given.
   And optimal policy or optimal path has to be found.

I have completed this task too, but a bit late and took suggestions for mentors.
